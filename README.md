# Eliot-s-NIKA
Branch of NIKA which adds custom functionality for RSoXS based in Igor Pro
developed by Eliot Gann at North Carolina State university with the help of many other people
contact Eliot Gann (eliot.gann@nist.gov) with any questions.

This is laregly extending upon on older altered version of NIKA.  This code will not function itself, but requires NIKA.  
These are just a set of useful tools which exend the capabilities which I made before I knew how to code properly.
